The motivation for initiating this project stemmed from the desire to develop a machine learning model capable of discerning emotions from our everyday conversations. Given the contemporary emphasis on personalization in various aspects of our lives, the idea was to create an emotion detector that could assess one's emotional state. The envisioned application extends beyond mere emotion detection, as it could potentially lead to personalized recommendations based on an individual's mood. Various industries, such as marketing, could leverage this technology to suggest products tailored to a person's emotions, while the automotive sector might utilize it to detect and adjust autonomous car speeds according to the driver's emotional state, thereby enhancing safety and preventing collisions.
